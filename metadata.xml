    <description>This mod allows you to check what is unlocked with ease!

As many modders know, Isaac's Mod API does not have a way to check whether any achievement, character, etc. is unlocked or not. This library allows you to do just that.

[h2]How does it work?[/h2]
This mod works by adding [strike]637[/strike] 201 items to the game (don't worry, you shouldn't encounter any of these in a run), each tied to one of the game's achievements, then at the start of a new run it checks it's availability along vanilla unlockables and if it succeeds it marks the associated achievement as unlocked.

[h2]Limitations[/h2]
[list]
[*]The check is only performed on the start of a new run, new floor or when continuing a run from the file menu.
[*]May cause TMTrainer items to be more boring (untested)
[/list]

[h2]Developer Info[/h2]
Head to the [url=https://github.com/Kevadroz/tboiAchievementUnlocker]GitHub repository[/url] for documentation.
This mod can't really be embedded inside another due to the 201 collectibles it adds.</description>
